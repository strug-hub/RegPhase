Description: The Regression-on-Phase (RoP) package provides a statistical method 
    to detect phase-specific effects between two genetic variants on 
    a continuous or binary outcome. By modeling the cis and trans 
    configurations of haplotypes, RoP enables researchers to test 
    whether the phase relationship between alleles contributes 
    to trait variation beyond marginal effects. The method supports 
    both biallelic and multiallelic variants and is compatible with 
    phased genotype data obtained from long-read sequencing or other 
    phasing tools. The package includes core functions to perform the 
    RoP test, along with detailed documentation and reproducible examples.
